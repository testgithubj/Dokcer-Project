# üöÄ DevOps Implementation Summary

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow using industry-standard tools and best practices. It includes Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Static Code Analysis via SonarQube.

## üîß Tools & Stack

| Area              | Tool / Tech            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| CI/CD             | GitHub Actions         |
| Runtime           | Node.js (v22)          |
| Infrastructure    | AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)       |
| Code Quality      | SonarQube (v10.3)      |
| Artifact Handling | GitHub Upload/Download |
| Containerization  | Docker (optional)      |

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)**

* Automatically triggered on every push to `main` branch
* Steps:

  * Checkout repo
  * Install Node.js and dependencies
  * Run `npm run check` test command
  * Generate artifact
  * Upload artifact
  * Deploy to self-hosted EC2 GitHub runner
  * Start app using `npm start` (no pm2)

---

### 2. **SonarQube Code Quality Scanning**

* SonarQube server configured manually on EC2
* Static Code Analysis done using CLI
* `sonar-project.properties` configured for scan
* Helps detect:

  * Bugs
  * Code smells
  * Vulnerabilities
* Ensures SQA (Software Quality Assurance) is automated

---

## üéØ Benefits for DevOps & QA Teams

* ‚úÖ Automated testing and deployment reduces manual errors
* ‚úÖ SonarQube improves code reliability and maintainability
* ‚úÖ GitHub Actions provides visibility into all build/deploy steps
* ‚úÖ Easily scalable for microservices or containerized environments
* ‚úÖ Saves time for QA team‚Äîbugs are caught earlier in the pipeline

---

## üìÅ Example sonar-project.properties

```ini
sonar.projectKey=my-node-app
sonar.sources=.
sonar.host.url=http://<your-ec2-ip>:9000
sonar.login=<your-sonarqube-token>
```

---

## üìù Future Plans

* Integrate Dockerized builds for both frontend & backend
* Deploy to Kubernetes (EKS) using Helm charts
* Use Vault for secure secret management

# Module-3-Deployment: Dockerized Express.js App with Nginx Proxy

## Project Description
This project contains a simple Express.js application containerized using Docker. It runs alongside an Nginx proxy server using Docker Compose. The goal is to demonstrate how to Dockerize a Node.js app, deploy it with Nginx, and manage multi-container Docker apps with Compose.

---

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/testgithubj/Module-3-deployment1.git
   cd Module-3-deployment1







## Prerequisites

- Node Version 22


### 1. For Run This Applications
```bash
# install packages
npm install 

# Testing The Applications
npm check

# For Run the application
npm start
```


### Deployment Process
1. **Cleanup**: Removes existing process if running
   ```bash
   pm2 delete node-app || true
   ```

2. **Start Application**: Launches with absolute path
   ```bash
   pm2 start "./src/server.js" --name node-app
   ```

3. **Save Process List**: Persists PM2 configuration
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

### About The Applications
1. **Route**: This Application has 2 route
   ```bash
   / # this will show a hello world page
   ```
      ```bash
   /api # this will response a json
   ```

2. **Default Port**: By Default this application will run on port 3000
